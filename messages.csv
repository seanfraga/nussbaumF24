The author argues that antelope are meant to live antelope lives and not made to be food how do you think that translates for animals that happen to be lower on the food chain? Do you think providing lab meat like the author suggests is realistic or better than “natural” prey-predator interactions?
On page 26 the author speaks about people wanting to see brutal predation attack coining it sado-tourism. Nussbaum is against the concept to this and does not think tourists need to see these acts. However if these acts of predation are natural and will occur regardless why should tourists not witness this especially if it helps fund national parks? How do we draw the line as to what parts of nature humans should witness?
"Nussbaum states in the article that ""At the very least we should not be scared off from going down that path by charges of “playing God.”"" However when can human beings be confident enough with our knowledge towards the ecosystem and ecology and comfortably claim that we can responsibly ""play God"" without leading to the potential destruction of the ecosystem?"
"Woah!  ""When humans do not intervene Nature does not attain a stable or balanced condition nor does it attain the condition that is best for other creatures or for the environment""
""There may sometimes be friendships between humans and wild animals (see chapter 11) but that possibility requires great humility and deference to the wild animal’s form of life"" do animals sacrifice their natural ways of life in developing a relationship with a human?"
Why would this not including humans killing animals for consumption? At this point our society has developed enough for us all to be vegan so what about consuming animals makes it more acceptable than killing an animal for material? 
"Nussbaum discusses how no part of the ""wild"" is untouched or uncontrolled by humans anymore and because of how involved we are in the ""wild"" there's now some sense of obligation to save prey animals from being preyed upon. My question is where is the circle of life in all of this?"
How should we navigate the treatment of invasive species? Just as Nussbaum argues that “antelopes were not made to be food they were made to live antelope lives” couldn’t one argue that invasive species are also entitled to their lives thus justifying their protection as well? If there even is a hypothetical perfect solution to this and/or predation where all species in the future live free from suffering is it practical?
"Nussbaum allows that ""rats and some other nuisance animals"" may be preyed on under theory of limiting predation. What do you think of this? Why do you think Nussbaum displays this preference for larger animals?"
"Nussbaum writes draws a comparison on efforts to stop climate change and animal justice by stating ""Stopping climate change requires a global will that is not yet established and if it is it won't reverse changes that have already taken place. So what about animals who are suffering right now?''. If after seeing blatant evidence of climate change how can we bring people onboard with animal stewardship when they already have an aversion to placing an equal value on animal life AND acting on it?"
What are examples of circumstances in which humans should and should not intervene with the protection of wildlife and on what basis?
Do you think ethical zoos can exist as long as they are for profit? Nussbaum mentions that all wild animals are confined at this point sometimes the confined spaces are just large enough we don’t think of it as confined. Is there a way to develop zoos (or public-accessible nature reserves) that keep animal interest in mind while appeasing the human desire to learn about wildlife?
Is it ever ethical to keep wild animals in captivity if the goal is education or conservation? What are the conditions that justify or disqualify captivity?
Is there a time you went out of your way to protect a non-domesticated animal? Do you think humans have a moral obligation to be concerned about other species flourishing?
"If you view animals companion or ""wild"" as being unexceptional can you claim to not be speciesist? "
 Do you think we have enough understanding to intervene in wild animal lives? Where should we draw the line between intervention and leaving animals to their natural environments?
Why do you think certain species gain more publicity than other species when seeing the apparent injustice they are subject against (i.e. orcas primarily focused on and declared act)? Is there a certain species that you want to provide voice or echo?
"This reading ""presupposes that there is such a thing in the world as “wild” Nature: spaces that are not under human control and supervision"". Is such a place possible when humans will always have the facilities to make any inch of the ""wild"" non-wild anymore? Will humans forever have this power over ""nature"" because of the new societal advancements? "
Does shared vulnerability between humans and animals influence our ethical responsibilities toward them and in what ways might this perspective shift current attitudes toward animal rights and conservation efforts?
"How do you define the ""balance of nature""? Do you think that animal suffering and species extinction are part of nature's balance? Or do you agree with the author that the idea of balance helps humans to escape from responsibilities? "
"Nussbaum writes that ‘It’s important to keep pointing out that antelopes were not made to be food they were made to live antelope lives.’ But when animals are kept in zoos without the presence of starvation/disease/predators they will lose the ability to survive in the wild (as Nussbaum noted in the example of dolphins). Do you agree with Nussbaum's statements about what a 'permissible zoo' looks like? In your opinion what will a 'permissible zoo' be or do you think zoos are never ethically permissible?
Nussbaum states that we are feeding animals meat that has been more ethically killed because of the fact that it has been killed by a human. Do you think that if humans kill animals it is more ethical and natural than an animal killing another animal?
Nussbaum mentions the population imbalances that often occur in “wild” spaces and the solutions that humans have drawn up in an attempt to address them. Do you think that these human interventions deprive a space of its “wildness”? In other words can we still deem the space wild? 
Cronon says that humans should not create a seperate concept of the wild as it puts distance instead of recognising that we are all part of the same ecosystem. Nussbaum also argues that we have influenced the wild and are not seperate from it but he also effectively argues that we as humans should play god when it comes to the wild which creates a sense of distance/superiority and seperation from nature/the wild. I feel these 2 arguments are both similar but also different. Do you agree that Nussbaum's argument to play god contradicts Cronon's idea that we should not hold ideas that seperate us from nature? which argument resonates more?
do we have a moral obligation to protect any animals? domestic and or wild? If we have an obligation to protect domestic animals but not wild ones what are the reasons/ what qualities set apart wild animals that set them outside of what we should morally consider
Do you like going to zoos? If you liked going to the zoo as a child what impact do you think it had on you while you were growing up? Also do you think we need zoos nowadays?
How far should human responsibility go leaning towards Nussbaum's argument that animals deserve justice? Should we for example intervene in the natural processes of prey animals? Should humans be held accountable for the effects of anthropogenic activities on animals or the suffering of wild animals? Where do we draw the line? 
Nussbaum writes “If by Nature and 'the wild' we mean the way things go when humans do not intervene that way is not so good for non-human animals.” Thinking back to our conversation on wilderness from a few weeks ago do we have a right to intervene in wilderness? How do we in a capitalistic economy intervene in wilderness in a manner that is fully 100% for the benefit of the wild?
"There are many examples where human interference leads to unintended consequences in the ""wild"" but many of us still feel an obligation to preserve it. What separates preservation of nature from being a pointless exercises of protecting a man made concept of ""the wild."""
If we take away the “majesticness” of the wild do we take away human incentive to protect it?
Where in the world/environment gives you that majestic feeling of “something truer deeper something uncorrupt and sublime”?
Nussbaum writes that one principle of justice for animals is to “not let yourself off the hook easily.” What are simple small ways in the day to day that you can hold yourself accountable in environmental stewardship?
